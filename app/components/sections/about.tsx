        These two seemingly disparate interests came together when I first wrote
        a few lines of CSS and JavaScript at work to update a simple button UI.

        &nbsp; I attended Springboard coding academy where I spent 8 months
        learning the fundamentals of front-end and back-end development while
        working full-time.

        . Through these experiences, I had the opportunity to not only enhance
        my front-end development skills but also develop a working style that
        leans towards
